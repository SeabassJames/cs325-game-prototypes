<h2>John Carbuckle Just Wants to Do His Laundry and Draw His Cartoons, but His Cats Won't Let Him</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
All sprites were original 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Many variables and sprites with multiple animations
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
I learned how to move in 2D space with the keyboard without gravity, and how to interact with objects without overlapping.<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
The easiest part was making the sprite for John, as I reused and recolored my DA1 sprite.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Loading screen: self-made</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>I think this game is similar to Five Nights At Freddy's, as you are managing multiple tasks to try and survive for a given amount of time</li>
<li>Part of the code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://seabassjames.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/HW0/index.html">My Digital Assignment 1</a></li>
<li>Part of the code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://seabassjames.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/DA2/index.html">My Digital Assignment 2</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
Celebrity cartoonist John Carbuckle just wants to do his laundry and draw his cartoons, but his cats won't let him. Try to do your laundry, draw your cartoons, and keep your curtains closed while your cats try to stop you.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.<br>
Cartoonist<br>
Person with lots and lots of cats<br>
Celebrity sighting<br>
Laundromat
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
Input: Direct Keyboard (arrow keys to move, space to interact)
Randomness: A lot of randomness (cats randomly decide when to interfere)
Genre: Task manager, role-playing game (playing the role of John Carbuckle)
Play Style: Achiever, joker
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
Testing multiple game states, interaction with objects, random triggering of events, and game end conditions
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
I want players to feel like they are John, and they just want to do their laundry and work on their cartoons in private
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
Move with arrow keys, space bar to close curtains, interact with washer/dryer, and draw cartoons at the desk.<br>
If the curtains are open, your privacy goes down. If they are closed, your privacy goes up. If you run out of privacy, game over.<br>
You want to finish your laundry. The laundry can only be completed if the washer/dryer is actually running. When the washer is done, move the clothes to the dryer.<br>
You also want to work on drawing your cartoons. Drawing cartoons increases your score.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
If the player is low on privacy, they may wish to stay near the window until their privacy recovers.<br>
If the curtains are closed and the laundry is running, the player may wish to stay at the desk and work on cartoons to increase their score.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
TBA<br>
You are John Carbuckle, celebrity cartoonist. You are trying to draw some cartoons and do some laundry in private, but your cats, Marthield, Lucield, and Roynald are causing trouble by messing with the curtains, washing machine, and dryer.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
People who enjoy imagining the daily life of a celebrity, people who like cats, or people who like sneaky references to Garfield and Fire Emblem.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br>
If the player doesn't close the curtains, the game may end in less than a minute.<br>
If the player wants to win, the game will take several minutes.
</li>
