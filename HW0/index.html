<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I made the sprites myself
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I attempted to allow the character to climb walls
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    I learned that sometimes, things are undefined for no apparent reason, even when they are created the same way as things that are not undefined.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    The easiest part was making the sprites. The hardest part was making the left wall behave.

    I made all assets from scratch in Paint.net
